        <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-6 opacity-90 leading-relaxed">
            My learning began with numbers — structured, logical, and certain.
            But it was in data, with all its imperfections and hidden patterns, that I found real curiosity.
            Over the last 2+ years, I have worked extensively on machine learning and deep learning projects,
            not as academic tasks, but as practical explorations of how models learn, fail, improve, and generalize.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-10 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I approach data science as a problem-solving discipline — combining mathematical reasoning,
            algorithmic thinking, and experimentation to extract insight from complex data.
            I am actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully,
            learn from real-world challenges, and grow as a data scientist in a rigorous environment.

            <div class="w-20 h-1 bg-blue-500 mb-6"></div>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I am a mathematics graduate with a strong inclination toward applied problem-solving.
                After completing my B.Sc. (Hons) in Mathematics from Ramanujan College, University of Delhi,
                I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematics with Computer Science from Jamia Millia Islamia.
                This academic background has trained me to think rigorously, reason logically,
                and approach problems with precision.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                While theory built my foundation, working with real data shaped my understanding.
                Over the past 2+ years, I have independently developed multiple machine learning and deep learning projects,
                gaining hands-on experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis,
                feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                My work spans supervised learning, deep learning-based image classification,
                NLP-driven sentiment analysis, and semantic search systems using vector embeddings.
                Through these projects, I have learned how algorithms behave on imperfect data,
                how assumptions break, and how iterative experimentation leads to meaningful insight.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
                I am motivated by environments that value clarity of thought, intellectual honesty,
                and practical impact. I am looking for opportunities where I can apply my skills responsibly,
                continue learning at depth, and contribute to data-driven decision-making.
